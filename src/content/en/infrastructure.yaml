    title: Secure Storage
    content: |
      Our database uses a secure and fast storage solution that leverages caching solutions for faster response times.
      This ensures that data is stored safely, is highly fault tolerant, and can be accessed quickly, with frequently accessed data stored in
      a cache for faster retrieval. By taking advantage of these technologies, we can provide our users with a
      fast and secure database experience.

    title: Regionally Served
    content: |
      We utilize a robust microservice approach running on a multi-cloud platform allowing us to use regional edge servers
      for faster response times. To ensure high availability, we use autoscaling clusters that adjust resources
      based on demand. These technologies enable us to provide a seamless user experience.

      It starts with the client's needs. Shippers and operators use our user-friendly interfaces to make
      deliveries and manage assets (aircraft, vertiports, hangars, and more!).

    title: Scheduling
    content: |
      Instant itinerary creation. Automated flight routing, regional compliance, aircraft selection, and vertiport booking. Schedule
      deliveries with your fleet (or with aircraft for hire) in just a few taps. Leave the complexities of aerial logistics and compliance to us,
      so you can take to the sky faster.

    title: Integrated Payments

      Configure your dynamic pricing models to set fees per flight. We'll handle payments from the customer, taking only a modest fee for managing the flight.

    title: Development
    content: |
      We originated from an open-source community, meaning all source code is available for public view, and we'll continue to develop in the open. We do this for transparency, to promote ethical decision-making, and to allow public audit.
      We want the public to see for themselves that their data is safe, and that we don't bias our software in favor of specific companies or demographics.
