    title: Secure Storage
    content: |
      Our database setup uses secure and fast storage and leverages caching solutions for faster response times.
      This ensures that data is stored safely and can be accessed quickly, with frequently accessed data stored in
      a cache for faster retrieval. By taking advantage of these technologies, we can provide our users with a
      fast and secure database experience.

    title: Locally Served
    content: |
      On a server local to your region, we take requests from shippers and operators to manage assets.
      We utilize a robust microservice approach running on a multi-cloud platform allowing us to use edge servers
      for faster response times. To ensure high availability, we use autoscaling clusters that adjust resources
      based on demand. These technologies enable us to provide a seamless user experience.

      It starts with the client's needs. Shippers and operators use our user-friendly interfaces to make
      deliveries and manage assets (aircraft, vertiports, hangars, and more!).

      If both vertiports and an aircraft are available for the desired delivery time, we will return a prospective
      flight plan for your approval. We will handle all of the flight details so you can focus on your business.
