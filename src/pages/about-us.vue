                The vision of Aetheric was clear from the beginning: to forge better connections between us and make the VTOL industry accessible to everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our team is small, cross-disciplined, flexible, and determined. We have great chemistry and a drive for automation. At our early stage, we are currently looking for partners that want to grow
                alongside us and capture the needs of this new era.

                Aetheric proudly traces its origins to the organization <a href="https://arrowair.com" alt="Arrow DAO website">Arrow DAO</a>.
                Founded during a time of rapid advancement in drone and passenger VTOL technology,
                this decentralized autonomous organization set out to engineer open-source VTOL technologies.
                More than just a new approach to engineering,
                the DAO serves as a creative hub and forum for members to spread optimism for the future.
                The community votes on DAO-wide decisions, including which projects to fund.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the earliest projects to be funded by Arrow DAO, our team proposed an airspace
                management and vertiport scheduling system to anticipate the demands of a VTOL world.
                Taking cues from the
                <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/20230002647/downloads/NASA-TM-20230002647_Final.pdf" alt="NASA UAM Research Roadmap">NASA UAM Roadmap</a> and <a href="https://www.sesarju.eu/U-space" alt="About U-space">U-space standard</a>, we built out
                a flexible and scalable microservice architecture that could adapt to the needs
                of evolving regulation. We invested time aggressively in workflow automation and
                infrastructure-as-code to be as productive and flexible to change as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the product developed, our team also formed a strong base with great chemistry.
                Aetheric is a cross-disciplinary team with just three
                core members at the helm:
                <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lottesara/" target="_blank"
                    >Lotte Laan</a
                >,
                <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/smitham42/" target="_blank"
                    >Alex Smith</a
                >
                and
                <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/smitham42/" target="_blank"
                    >Geertje Ruitenburg</a
                >. Along with contributions from freelance developers and designers,
                our powerful trio produced working prototypes for both the <b>Realm</b> network and the <b>Hangar</b> software.
            </p>
            <p>
                With stellar results and a successful DAO-wide vote for a funding round, our team elected to take
                the next step forward and establish Aetheric B.V. (est. 2024). We're now in the process of meeting
                new investors and prospective users. Arrow DAO is a major non-owner shareholder in our venture
                and continues to be a strong supporter of our mission.
