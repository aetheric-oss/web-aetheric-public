                The vision of Aetheric was clear from the beginning; the VTOL
                industry should be globally available.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our technology will allow numerous operators and asset owners to
                coordinate vertiport and VTOL access on a collectively grown
                network.

                Towards the future we are looking for partners that want to grow
                with us and have all benefits that come with it.

            <h2>The journey started in 2021..</h2>
            <p>
                When the world of VTOL started to unfold, a startup investor
                from the USA decided to fund an organization called ARROW folded
                into the form of a DAO. This decentralized autonomous
                organization finds its history in the crypto scene, where a new
                form of business was needed. DAO's generally are used as a
                creative hub to solve new user journeys as the essence of it
                pushes its members to debate, philosophy and decide as a team
                what direction to take. The ARROW DAO's only mission is to
                create a future where VTOLs are available for everyone.
            </p>
            <p>
                People started joining the community, teams started to form and
                within no-time various projects started. The first is an
                engineering team based in Turkey who are developing an actual
                vehicle. The second team standing strong started the development
                for software. And what started as a rideshare platform now has
                the base to become one of the most trusted AAM ecosystems out
                there.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the product developed, our team also formed a strong base.
                Aetheric has a team of freelancers behind it and has three
                core-members steering it

            </p>
            <p>
                As happens with most DAO products, the software was growing up
                and needed a more regular shape of business to further grow,
                being able to attract new investors, customers and work with
                government organizations. Aetheric was born with ARROW still at
                the core of it.
