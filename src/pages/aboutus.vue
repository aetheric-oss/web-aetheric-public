       <center><p style="max-width: 600px;">The vision of Aetheric was clear from the beginning; the VTOL industry should be globally available.</p>
                <p style="max-width: 600px;">Our technology will allow numerous operators and asset owners to coordinate vertiport and VTOL access on a collectively grown network.</p>
        <p style="max-width: 600px;">Towards the future we are looking for partners that want to grow with us and have all benefits that come with it.</p>

                    <h2>The journey started in 2021..</h2>
                    <p>When the world of VTOL started to unfold, a startup investor from the USA decided to fund an organisation called ARROW folded into the form of a DAO. This decentralised autonomous organization finds its history in the crypto scene, where a new form of business was needed. DAO's generally are used as a creative hub to solve new user journeys as the essence of it pushes its members to debate, philosoph and decide as a team what direction to take. The ARROW DAO's only mission is to create a future where VTOLS are available for everyone. </p>
                    <p>People started joining the community, teams started to form and within no-time various projects started. The first is an engineering team based in Turkey who are developing an actual vehicle. The second team standing strong started the development for software. And what started as a rideshare platform now has the base to become one of the most trusted AAM ecosystems out there.</p>
                    <p>As the product developed, our team also formed a strong base. Aetheric has a team of freelancers behind it and has three core-members steering it <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lottesara/" target="_blank">Lotte Laan</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/smitham42/" target="_blank">Alex Smith</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/smitham42/" target="_blank">Geertje Ruitenburg</a>. A powerful trio that combines over half a century of knowledge in software development.</p>
                    <p>As happens with most DAO products, the software was growing up and needed a more regular shape of business to further grow, being able to attract new investors, customers and work with goverment organisations. Aetheric was born with ARROW still at the core of it. </p>
